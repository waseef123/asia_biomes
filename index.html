        <h3>Asia is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population. It covers an area of more than
            44 million square kilometers, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Asia is home to the world's earliest civilizations. Its indigenous cultures pioneered many practices that
            have been integral to societies for centuries, such as agriculture, city planning, and religion. The social
            and political geography of the continent continues to inform and influence the rest of the world.</h3>

    <h4>Asia is by far the most populous region in the world
        representing about 60 percent of the total world
        population. The population of Asia is projected to increase
        from 4.64 billion people in 2020 to 5.267 billion people in
        2050, meaning that by 2050 the number of people in Asia
        will be the same as the entire world population in 1990.
        The explosive growth in the Asian population combined with
        economic growth and the increase in the number of
        consumers require massive amounts of natural resources.</h4>

            The hottest country in Asia is
            the United Arab Emirates. This,
            however, is based on dry heat
            levels, which can be intolerable
            in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. As far
            as heat and humidity levels,
            Israel is the hottest country in
            Asia.

    <h1>What Is Tundra Biome ?<h1>
            <br>

            <h3>Tundra ecosystems are treeless regions found in the
                Arctic and on the tops of mountains,<br> where the climate is
                cold and windy, and rainfall is scant. <br>Tundra lands are
                covered with snow for much of the year, but summer
                brings bursts of wildflowers. Plants and Animals in
                Tundras</h3>
            <br>
            <h1>What Is Grassland Biome ?</h1>
            <h3>The grassland biome is made up of large open areas of grasses. They are maintained by grazing animals
                and frequent fires. <br>Types of grasslands include savannas and temperate grasslands.</h3>

            <br>
            <h1>What Is a Forest Biome ?</h1>
            <h3>Forest biomes are made up of trees and other woody plants. There are many types of forests. They are
                located in different parts of the world. The climate is different in each type of forest. Therefore, the
                plants and animals that can live in each type of forest are different.</h3>

            <br>

            <h1>What Is A Desert Biome ?</h1>
            <h3>Desert biomes are the driest of all the biomes. An important characteristic of a desert is that it
                receives very little rainfall. Most deserts receive less than 300 mm a year compared to rainforests,
                which receive over 2,000 mm.</h3>
